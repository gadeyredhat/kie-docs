= Error message format

{PRODUCT} displays the error messages in a standard format which makes it easier to identify or interpret the error message.

An error message consists of message blocks. It can have a total of five blocks, with three being mandatory and two being optional. To better understand this format, refer to the following example:

* *1st Block*: This block identifies the numeric error code.

* *2nd Block*: This block identifies the line and column information.

* *3rd Block*: This block describes the error.

* *4th Block*: This block is the first context which identifies the rule, function, template or query where the error occurs. This is an optional block.

* *5th Block*: This block identifies the pattern where the error occurs. This is also an optional block.
