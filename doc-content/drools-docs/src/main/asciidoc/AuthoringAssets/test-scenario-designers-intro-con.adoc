= Using the Test Scenario designer in {CENTRAL}

{PRODUCT} ships with two designers for you to create and run test scenarios to validate your business rules and data. The difference between them is that the *Test Scenario* designer creates and runs DMN-based test scenarios whereas the *Test Scenario (Legacy)* designer creates and runs rules-based test scenarios. Both are supported by Red Hat for production use. The sections covered in this chapter will help you understand how to use the *Test Scenario* designer to create and run test scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the *Test Scenario* designer can only use the default KIE session.
